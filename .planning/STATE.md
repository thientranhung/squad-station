# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08 after v1.2 milestone start)

**Core value:** Routing messages reliably between Orchestrator and agents — send task to right agent, receive completion signal, notify Orchestrator — all via stateless CLI commands, no daemon
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — CI/CD Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (CI/CD Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: In progress — awaiting human verification (Task 2: push v0.1.0-test tag, verify 4 CI jobs + 4 release assets)
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — Phase 7 Plan 1: release workflow created (.github/workflows/release.yml)

Progress: [#░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17 (across v1.0 + v1.1)
- v1.2 plans completed: 0

**By Phase (v1.2):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 7. CI/CD Pipeline | TBD | - | - |
| 8. npm Package | TBD | - | - |
| 9. Install Script and Docs | TBD | - | - |
| Phase 07-ci-cd-pipeline P01 | 45 | 2 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 and v1.1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.2 context:**
- npm wrapper chosen as primary distribution (target audience: developers with Node.js)
- curl | sh as npm-free alternative — no checksum verification in v1.2 (deferred to v1.3)
- 4 binary targets: darwin-arm64, darwin-x86_64, linux-arm64, linux-x86_64 (no Windows — tmux not available)
- Phase 7 is a blocker for both Phase 8 and Phase 9 (both download from GitHub Releases)

**Phase 7 — 07-01 decisions:**
- musl over gnu for Linux: fully static binaries with no glibc dependency (Phase 9 install script portability)
- cross tool only for aarch64-unknown-linux-musl: macOS and x86_64 Linux build natively
- softprops/action-gh-release@v2: idempotent release creation, safe for concurrent matrix uploads
- Binary naming: squad-station-{os}-{arch} — Phases 8 and 9 depend on this exact convention
- SQLX_OFFLINE=true always required: no .sqlx metadata present in repo
- [Phase 07-ci-cd-pipeline]: musl over gnu for Linux targets: fully static binaries for Phase 9 install script portability
- [Phase 07-ci-cd-pipeline]: Binary naming convention squad-station-{os}-{arch}: Phases 8 and 9 depend on this exact pattern
- [Phase 07-ci-cd-pipeline]: musl-tools apt install required for x86_64-unknown-linux-musl: Rust musl target needs musl-gcc linker not present by default on ubuntu-latest

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
