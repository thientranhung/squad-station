# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Routing messages reliably between Orchestrator and agents — send task to right agent, receive completion signal, notify Orchestrator — all via stateless CLI commands, no daemon
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Core Foundation)
Plan: 4 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-06 — Completed plan 01-04 (list + peek query commands)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~3.5 min
- Total execution time: ~7 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 2 | ~7 min | ~3.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4 min), 01-04 (3 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-core-foundation P05 | 4 | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks P01 | 2 | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks P02 | 3 | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks P03 | 1 | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use rusqlite (bundled) with WAL mode + busy_timeout=5000 + BEGIN IMMEDIATE for all writes — must be wired before migrations run, not inside a migration
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use serde-saphyr (not serde_yaml which is archived) for squad.yml parsing — verify exact crates.io version before locking Cargo.toml
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Use std::process::Command for tmux operations — always use -l (literal) flag for send-keys to prevent special character injection
- [Pre-Phase 2]: Gemini CLI AfterAgent hook JSON payload is not fully documented — must verify against current docs during Phase 2 planning
- [01-01]: Stayed with sqlx (not rusqlite) since it was already in Cargo.toml; used max_connections(1) write pool to prevent async deadlock
- [01-01]: Extracted tmux arg builder helpers (private fns) for unit testability without invoking real tmux binary
- [01-01]: Used serde-saphyr 0.0.17 pinned (pre-1.0 API, pin prevents breaking changes from minor updates)
- [Phase 01-04]: ANSI-safe padding via pad_colored() helper: compute trailing spaces from raw text length to avoid ANSI escape bytes corrupting column alignment in table output
- [Phase 01-04]: peek returns Ok(()) for no-task result — missing pending tasks is normal agent operation, not error
- [Phase 01]: Used std::io::IsTerminal (stdlib) for terminal detection — owo-colors v3 has no stream module
- [Phase 01-02]: Orchestrator role hardcoded to 'orchestrator' in insert_agent call — config.orchestrator.role ignored to enforce structural distinction
- [Phase 01]: signal retrieves task_id via SELECT after UPDATE rather than RETURNING clause for SQLite compatibility
- [Phase 01-02]: register does not launch tmux session — DB-only operation, user manages session lifecycle separately
- [Phase 01-02]: register DB path: squad.yml in cwd preferred, SQUAD_STATION_DB env var fallback — consistent with init's resolution approach
- [Phase 01-core-foundation]: lib.rs + main.rs split: expose internal modules as library surface for integration test access — standard Rust pattern for testable binaries
- [Phase 01-core-foundation]: update_status subquery: SQLite does not support UPDATE...ORDER BY...LIMIT without compile flag — use WHERE id = (SELECT id ... LIMIT 1) subquery instead
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Guard order in signal.rs: TMUX_PANE first (cheapest), then config/DB, agent lookup, orchestrator role check
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Unregistered agent in signal returns Ok(()) silently — bail! replaced for hook context compatibility (HOOK-03)
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Orchestrator self-signal guard (role == 'orchestrator') prevents AfterAgent hook infinite loop (HOOK-01)
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Agent status updated in send (busy) and signal (idle) to maintain accurate lifecycle state across send->signal arc
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: context command has no --json flag -- always outputs Markdown for AI consumption, not TTY display
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Reconciliation loop duplicated in agents.rs and context.rs rather than shared -- coupling two independent command files adds more complexity than the ~10 line duplication
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Hook scripts use SQUAD_STATION_BIN env var for custom binary path and TMUX_PANE (not TMUX) for reliable pane-based session name resolution
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Guard 1 tested via subprocess binary invocation — most reliable way to validate TMUX_PANE guard end-to-end
- [Phase 02-lifecycle-and-hooks]: Hook shell scripts not tested programmatically — require live tmux session per RESEARCH.md Validation Architecture

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Gemini CLI hook schema (AfterAgent event payload) needs empirical verification during Phase 2 planning — not fully documented
- [01-01 Resolved]: serde-saphyr community size concern — verified works correctly in practice, serde_yml fallback not needed
