# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Routing messages reliably between Orchestrator and agents — send task to right agent, receive completion signal, notify Orchestrator — all via stateless CLI commands, no daemon
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Schema and Config Refactor

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 6 (Schema and Config Refactor)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (04-03 complete — Phase 4 DONE)
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — 04-03 schema integration wave complete (AGNT-01/02/03, 124/124 tests green)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 43%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10 (v1.0)
- Average duration: — (v1.1 not started)
- Total execution time: — (v1.1 not started)

**By Phase (v1.0 complete):**

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Core Foundation | 5/5 | Complete |
| 2. Lifecycle and Hooks | 3/3 | Complete |
| 3. Views and TUI | 2/2 | Complete |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.1 design decisions (locked):**
- `project` config → string format (matches Obsidian design)
- `command` field → removed from AgentConfig
- CLI `send` → `--body` flag
- `provider` → renamed to `tool`
- Signal format → `"<agent> completed <msg-id>"`
- Agent naming → auto-prefix `<project>-<tool>-<role>` on init
- CONF-04 and AGNT-03 (provider→tool) land in same phase to keep DB + config in sync

**04-01 execution decisions:**
- SQUAD_STATION_DB env var check moved into resolve_db_path so all commands benefit without individual changes
- init.rs uses minimal stubs (TODO: Plan 03) — agent name auto-derived from project+tool+role pattern
- All integration test helpers updated to use cmd_with_db() for test DB injection

**04-02 execution decisions:**
- agent_name column set to to_agent value on INSERT for backward compat with peek_message/update_status subqueries
- #[sqlx(rename = "tool")] added to agents.rs provider field as bridge until Plan 03 completes full rename
- All test suite call sites updated in this plan (blocking issue, Rule 3) — new insert_message signature required it

**04-03 execution decisions:**
- Agent.command kept as Option<String> with #[allow(dead_code)] — SELECT * includes it, removing requires explicit SELECT on 4 query fns
- insert_agent passes '' for command column to satisfy NOT NULL constraint without ALTER TABLE
- current_task FK lifecycle handled inline in send/signal with raw sqlx::query — keeps db::agents API minimal
- list.rs FROM/TO columns replace AGENT column — directional routing surfaced in default table output

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None — all design decisions resolved, ready to build.
