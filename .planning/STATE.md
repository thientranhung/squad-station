# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Routing messages reliably between Orchestrator and agents — send task to right agent, receive completion signal, notify Orchestrator — all via stateless CLI commands, no daemon
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Feature Completion

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 6 (Feature Completion)
Plan: 1 of N in current phase (05-01 complete — HOOK-01 and HOOK-02 done)
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — 05-01 notification hooks complete (claude-code-notify.sh + gemini-cli-notify.sh)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 43%

## Performance Metrics

| 2. Lifecycle and Hooks | 3/3 | Complete |
| 3. Views and TUI | 2/2 | Complete |
| Phase 05-feature-completion P02 | 239 | 2 tasks | 11 files |
| Phase 06-documentation P01 | 2 | 1 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.1 design decisions (locked):**
- `project` config → string format (matches Obsidian design)
- `command` field → removed from AgentConfig
- CLI `send` → `--body` flag
- `provider` → renamed to `tool`
- Signal format → `"<agent> completed <msg-id>"`
- Agent naming → auto-prefix `<project>-<tool>-<role>` on init
- CONF-04 and AGNT-03 (provider→tool) land in same phase to keep DB + config in sync

**04-01 execution decisions:**
- SQUAD_STATION_DB env var check moved into resolve_db_path so all commands benefit without individual changes
- init.rs uses minimal stubs (TODO: Plan 03) — agent name auto-derived from project+tool+role pattern
- All integration test helpers updated to use cmd_with_db() for test DB injection

**04-02 execution decisions:**
- agent_name column set to to_agent value on INSERT for backward compat with peek_message/update_status subqueries
- #[sqlx(rename = "tool")] added to agents.rs provider field as bridge until Plan 03 completes full rename
- All test suite call sites updated in this plan (blocking issue, Rule 3) — new insert_message signature required it

**04-03 execution decisions:**
- Agent.command kept as Option<String> with #[allow(dead_code)] — SELECT * includes it, removing requires explicit SELECT on 4 query fns
- insert_agent passes '' for command column to satisfy NOT NULL constraint without ALTER TABLE
- current_task FK lifecycle handled inline in send/signal with raw sqlx::query — keeps db::agents API minimal
- list.rs FROM/TO columns replace AGENT column — directional routing surfaced in default table output

**05-01 execution decisions:**
- Both notify hooks share identical implementation body — only header comments differ (provider-specific registration instructions)
- python3 used for JSON parsing inline — consistent with existing project hooks, no new dependencies
- Orchestrator discovered at runtime via `squad-station agents --json` — keeps hooks stateless
- Message format `[NOTIFY] <agent> needs permission: <message>` — prefix enables orchestrator pattern-matching
- [Phase 05-02]: CLI-01: Send uses --body named flag — replaces positional task arg for discoverability and shell safety
- [Phase 05-02]: CLI-02: init.rs enforces <project>-<tool>-<role> naming; squad.yml name field acts as role suffix
- [Phase 05-02]: CLI-03: context output uses Markdown ## headings with model/description per agent, not table format
- [Phase 05-02]: SIG-01: Signal notification format is '<agent> completed <msg-id>' — pattern-matchable by orchestrator
- [Phase 06-01]: Removed 'not rusqlite' contrast phrase to meet zero-rusqlite-occurrences done criterion; document is self-evidently about sqlx
- [Phase 06-01]: Added explicit src/tmux.rs reference in Overview for grep-based verification to work (tree diagram alone lacked src/ prefix)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
