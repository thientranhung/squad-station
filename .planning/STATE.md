## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.3 context (relevant carry-overs):**
- `context` command is read-only — no tmux reconciliation, writes `.agent/workflows/` from DB state only
- JSON mode guard in `init.rs` — hook instructions suppressed from stdout when `--json` active
- `.agent/workflows/` is the IDE orchestrator context path (3 files in v1.3; v1.4 replaces with 1 file)
- `SQUAD_STATION_DB` env var in `resolve_db_path` — single injection point for all commands; override must survive v1.4 path change
- [Phase 14-unified-orchestrator-playbook]: Made build_orchestrator_md pub so integration tests can import it; orchestrator agents excluded from delegation block but included in roster table
- [Phase 14-unified-orchestrator-playbook]: Anti-context-decay rule references squad-orchestrator.md explicitly — single file is the reset point for context recovery
- [Phase 14-unified-orchestrator-playbook]: Only the squad-delegate.md path in the Get Started println was changed — all other init.rs logic preserved

### Pending Todos
