# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09 after v1.2 milestone)

**Core value:** Routing messages reliably between Orchestrator and agents — send task to right agent, receive completion signal, notify Orchestrator — all via stateless CLI commands, no daemon
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — Centralized Hooks

## Current Position

Phase: 10 of 13 (Centralized Hooks)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — v1.3 roadmap created, 4 phases mapped to 15 requirements

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.3 context:**
- Phases 10-13 cover: centralized hooks, antigravity provider, IDE context generation, safe tmux injection
- Hook shell scripts deprecated in favor of inline `squad-station signal $TMUX_PANE`
- Antigravity provider = DB-only orchestrator (no tmux sessions, no tmux notifications)
- `.agent/workflows/` is the new IDE orchestrator context path (3 files: delegate, monitor, roster)
- Safe multiline injection via load-buffer/paste-buffer replaces direct send-keys for content delivery
- [Phase 10-centralized-hooks]: Signal pane ID detection via starts_with('%') prefix — tmux pane IDs always use % prefix, session names cannot
- [Phase 10-centralized-hooks]: HOOK-01: signal exits 0 silently on pane resolution failure — providers must never see errors from hooks
- [Phase 10-centralized-hooks]: HOOK-02: Deprecation block inserted after shebang before existing description header — all executable logic unchanged for backward compatibility
- [Phase 11-antigravity-provider-core]: is_db_only() checks tool == 'antigravity' — tool remains open string so unknown providers continue as tmux providers
- [Phase 11-antigravity-provider-core]: Use inline orch.tool == 'antigravity' in signal.rs (not is_db_only()) — Agent DB struct should not couple to config domain knowledge
- [Phase 11-antigravity-provider-core]: DB-only orchestrator excluded from all-failed total count — it is never launched so can never fail
- [Phase 12-ide-context-hook-setup]: context command is read-only: removed tmux reconciliation loop — context writes .agent/workflows/ files from DB state without mutating tmux or DB
- [Phase 12-ide-context-hook-setup]: JSON mode guard in init.rs: hook instructions suppressed from stdout when --json flag active to preserve machine-parseable output
- [Phase 12-ide-context-hook-setup]: HOOK-03/04: merge_hook_entry uses dedup on command field, graceful fallback on malformed JSON, .json.bak backup via path.with_extension
- [Phase 13-safe-injection-and-documentation]: inject_body uses load-buffer/paste-buffer with uuid-named temp file; -t flag not -p for paste-buffer; temp cleanup on all paths
- [Phase 13-safe-injection-and-documentation]: PLAYBOOK.md v1.3: inline hook command is canonical (hooks/claude-code.sh deprecated), Notification hook uses permission_prompt matcher, Antigravity polling is expected behavior

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
