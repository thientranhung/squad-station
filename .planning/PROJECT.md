# Squad Station

## What This Is

Squad Station là một stateless CLI binary (Rust + embedded SQLite) hoạt động như trạm trung chuyển messages giữa AI Orchestrator và N agents chạy trong tmux sessions. Provider-agnostic — hỗ trợ bất kỳ AI coding tool nào (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Aider...). Người dùng chỉ tương tác với Orchestrator, Station lo việc routing messages, tracking trạng thái agent, và cung cấp fleet monitoring qua TUI dashboard và tmux views.

## Core Value

Routing messages đáng tin cậy giữa Orchestrator và agents — gửi task đúng agent, nhận signal khi hoàn thành, notify Orchestrator — tất cả qua stateless CLI commands không cần daemon.

### Active

### Out of Scope

- Task management / workflow logic — đó là việc của Orchestrator AI
- Orchestration decisions / reasoning — đó là việc của AI model
- File sync / code sharing giữa agents — agents work on same codebase via git
- Web UI / browser dashboard — TUI sufficient, complexity not justified
- Git conflict resolution giữa agents — orchestrator should sequence work to avoid
- Agent-to-agent direct messaging — all communication routes through orchestrator
- Offline mode — stateless CLI always needs tmux + DB

## Context

Shipped v1.4 Unified Playbook & Local DB with 6,169 LOC Rust (codebase + tests).
Tech stack: Rust, SQLite (sqlx 0.8), clap 4, ratatui 0.26, serde-saphyr, owo-colors 3, uuid (temp file naming).
Distribution: npm package + curl | sh installer, both download pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions matrix workflow produces 4 musl/darwin binaries on v* tag push.
Providers supported: claude-code, gemini-cli, antigravity (DB-only IDE orchestrator).
Hook registration: inline `squad-station signal $TMUX_PANE` command (scripts in hooks/ deprecated).
Context generation: `.agent/workflows/squad-orchestrator.md` — single unified playbook for IDE orchestrator.
Safe injection: load-buffer/paste-buffer pattern for multiline task bodies (no shell-injection artifacts).
Database: `.squad/station.db` in project directory (no home-dir dependency, no `dirs` crate).

## Constraints

- **Language**: Rust — single binary, zero runtime dependency, cross-compile cho darwin/linux
- **Database**: SQLite embedded — 1 DB file per project tại `<cwd>/.squad/station.db`
- **Architecture**: Stateless CLI — mỗi command chạy xong exit, không daemon, không background process
- **Communication**: tmux send-keys để inject prompt vào agent, tmux capture-pane để đọc output
- **Distribution**: npm package wrapper — download pre-built binary phù hợp platform
- **Repo**: Dedicated repo riêng cho Rust binary (repo hiện tại: squad-station)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rust thay vì Go | Binary nhỏ hơn, performance tốt hơn, user preference | ✓ Good — 2,994 LOC, fast compile, single binary |
| Stateless CLI, không daemon | Đơn giản, dễ debug, event-driven qua hook chain | ✓ Good — no process management complexity |
| SQLite embedded per project | Isolation giữa projects, không cần external DB | ✓ Good — WAL mode handles concurrent writes |
| Agent name = tmux session name | Đơn giản hóa lookup, hook tự detect qua TMUX_PANE | ✓ Good — zero-config agent identity |
| npm wrapper distribution | Target audience là developers đã có Node.js | ✓ Good — npm + curl | sh both shipped v1.2 |
| Provider-agnostic design | Không lock-in vào Claude Code hay Gemini CLI | ✓ Good — hooks work for both providers |
| Hook-driven completion | Agent passive, không cần modify agent behavior | ✓ Good — clean separation of concerns |
| sqlx over rusqlite | Already in Cargo.toml, async-native, compile-time SQL checks | ✓ Good — migration system worked well |
| max_connections(1) write pool | Prevents async write-contention deadlock in SQLite | ✓ Good — no busy errors in testing |
| INSERT OR IGNORE for agents | Idempotent registration, safe for duplicate hook fires | ✓ Good — MSG-03 satisfied cleanly |
| connect-per-refresh in TUI | Prevents WAL checkpoint starvation during long TUI sessions | ✓ Good — WAL doesn't grow unbounded |
| Reconciliation loop duplication | Each command file independent, ~10 lines not worth abstraction | ✓ Good — simple, no coupling |
| `--body` flag for `send` | Named flags more discoverable and shell-safe than positional args | ✓ Good — cleaner UX, pattern-matchable |
| Auto-prefix agent naming | Enforces `<project>-<tool>-<role>` convention without manual coordination | ✓ Good — avoids name collisions across projects |
| `provider`→`tool` rename | Matches solution design terminology; aligns with squad.yml and DB | ✓ Good — consistent naming across all layers |
| Notification hooks separate from Stop hooks | Notification fires on permission prompts, not task completion — distinct behavior | ✓ Good — both hook types needed |
| Signal format `"<agent> completed <msg-id>"` | Pattern-matchable string, no JSON parsing needed in orchestrator | ✓ Good — simple, grep-friendly |
| SQUAD_STATION_DB env var in resolve_db_path | Single injection point benefits all commands without per-command changes | ✓ Good — cleaner test isolation |
| musl over gnu for Linux targets | Produces fully static binaries, no glibc dependency — required for install script portability | ✓ Good — runs on any Linux distro |
| cross tool only for linux-arm64 | aarch64-musl requires cross-compilation; native cargo sufficient for darwin and linux-x86_64 | ✓ Good — minimal Docker overhead |
| softprops/action-gh-release@v2 | Idempotent — creates release if absent, appends assets if present; safe for 4 parallel matrix uploads | ✓ Good — race-condition-free releases |
| curl \| sh as npm alternative | Targets users without Node.js; POSIX sh for max portability | ✓ Good — covers non-Node environments |
| Binary naming `squad-station-{os}-{arch}` | Consistent convention consumed by npm postinstall and install script | ✓ Good — both distribution paths aligned |
| Pane ID detection via `starts_with('%')` | tmux pane IDs always use `%` prefix, session names cannot — zero-ambiguity detection | ✓ Good — clean signal arg dispatch |
| `signal` exits 0 silently on pane resolution failure | Hook context — providers must never see errors from hooks (infinite loop risk) | ✓ Good — safe hook behavior |
| `is_db_only()` checks `tool == "antigravity"` | Open string — unknown providers remain tmux providers by default, no config migration needed | ✓ Good — forward-compatible |
| Inline `orch.tool == "antigravity"` in signal.rs | Agent DB struct should not couple to config domain knowledge; check at call site | ✓ Good — clean domain boundaries |
| `context` command is read-only | Removed tmux reconciliation from `context`; DB state only → less side effects | ✓ Good — predictable, idempotent |
| JSON mode guard in `init.rs` | Hook instructions suppressed from stdout when `--json` active — preserves machine-parseable output | ✓ Good — composable CLI |
| `inject_body` uses uuid-named temp file | Prevents concurrent `send` calls from clobbering each other's buffer; cleanup on all code paths | ✓ Good — safe concurrent usage |
| PLAYBOOK.md inline hook as canonical | Shell scripts in `hooks/` deprecated — single install path reduces user confusion | ✓ Good — clearer onboarding |
| Single unified `squad-orchestrator.md` | One file replaces 3 fragmented workflow files — reduces context load for orchestrator | ✓ Good — simpler context loading |
| `build_orchestrator_md` as pub function | Integration tests can import and verify playbook content directly | ✓ Good — testable playbook generation |
| DB at `<cwd>/.squad/station.db` | Data locality — no home-dir resolution, no project-name collision risk | ✓ Good — simpler path, no `dirs` crate |
| No old DB migration | Dev builds only, no production data to preserve — clean break | ✓ Good — zero complexity |
