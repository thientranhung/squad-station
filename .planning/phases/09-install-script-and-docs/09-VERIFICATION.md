### Human Verification Required

The following items cannot be verified programmatically and require a human or CI run:

#### 1. End-to-end curl install on a clean macOS machine

**Test:** On a machine with no `squad-station` binary, run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thientranhung/squad-station/main/install.sh | sh`
**Expected:** Script downloads the correct binary for the host platform, installs to `/usr/local/bin/squad-station`, and `squad-station --version` prints the version.
**Why human:** Requires a live GitHub Release at v0.1.0 with the binary assets actually uploaded. Cannot verify that the release exists or that the download URL resolves without a network call to GitHub.

#### 2. End-to-end curl install on a Linux machine (x86_64 and arm64)

**Test:** Same as above on a Linux host.
**Expected:** `linux-x86_64` or `linux-arm64` binary is downloaded and installed correctly.
**Why human:** Cross-platform behavior requires an actual Linux environment.

#### 3. Fallback to ~/.local/bin when /usr/local/bin is not writable

**Test:** In an environment where `/usr/local/bin` is not writable (non-root Linux), run the install script.
**Expected:** Script installs to `~/.local/bin/squad-station` and prints the PATH advisory message.
**Why human:** Requires a controlled environment where the writable check actually triggers the fallback path.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All must-haves verified against the actual codebase. Both artifacts (`install.sh` and `README.md`) are substantive, complete, and committed. All 6 requirements (INST-01 through INST-03, DOC-01 through DOC-03) are satisfied by implementation evidence in the files. The three human verification items above are deployment-time checks that depend on a live GitHub Release — they are expected and appropriate for this phase.
