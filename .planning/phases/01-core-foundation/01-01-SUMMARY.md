# Phase 1 Plan 01: Core Foundation Bootstrap Summary

**sqlx 0.8 SQLite with WAL+single-writer pool, clap 6-subcommand CLI, serde-saphyr config, tmux send-keys -l enforcement, and SIGPIPE reset — all safety primitives (SAFE-01 through SAFE-04) wired at infrastructure level**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~4 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-06T05:04:10Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-06T05:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 14 (13 created, 1 modified)

## Accomplishments
- Full Rust binary skeleton compiling from scratch with all modules declared and wired
- All 4 safety requirements (SAFE-01 through SAFE-04) implemented at infrastructure level, not deferred
- tmux module has 4 passing unit tests verifying -l flag presence (SAFE-02) and direct command launch (SAFE-03) via arg vector inspection

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: CLI skeleton, config, entry point** - `08d65a8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: DB layer — connection, migration, CRUD** - `22fe8dd` (feat)
3. **Task 3: tmux module with tests** - `3803d93` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `Cargo.toml` — sqlx upgraded to 0.8, serde-saphyr/owo-colors/libc/dirs added
- `Cargo.lock` — dependency lock file generated
- `build.rs` — migration rebuild trigger for cargo
- `src/main.rs` — SIGPIPE reset + tokio::main + Cli::parse() + command dispatch
- `src/cli.rs` — Cli, Commands enum (6 subcommands), Priority with Display
- `src/config.rs` — SquadConfig/ProjectConfig/AgentConfig + load_config + resolve_db_path
- `src/db/mod.rs` — connect() with WAL + busy_timeout + max_connections(1) + migrate!
- `src/db/migrations/0001_initial.sql` — agents + messages tables with FK + 2 indexes
- `src/db/agents.rs` — Agent struct + insert_agent/get_agent/list_agents
- `src/db/messages.rs` — Message struct + insert_message/update_status/list_messages/peek_message
- `src/tmux.rs` — send_keys_literal/session_exists/launch_agent + 4 unit tests
- `src/commands/mod.rs` — 6 submodule declarations
- `src/commands/{init,send,signal,list,peek,register}.rs` — stubs with todo!()

## Decisions Made
- Stayed with sqlx over rusqlite (already in Cargo.toml; used max_connections(1) to mitigate async write-contention)
- Extracted tmux arg builder helpers as private functions so unit tests can verify arg vectors without invoking real tmux binary
- Used INSERT OR IGNORE + UPDATE WHERE status='pending' for MSG-03 idempotency at DB level
- Used serde-saphyr 0.0.17 (pinned exact version since it is pre-1.0 API)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

The plan specified all three tasks to be implemented and the final structure matched the plan's artifact list exactly. The only note is that `cargo test --lib tmux` failed (no library target in binary crate), but `cargo test` runs the same tests in the binary test harness — all 4 tests pass.

## Issues Encountered

- `cargo test --lib tmux` command in the plan's verify step returned an error ("no library targets found") because this is a binary crate, not a library crate. Fixed by running `cargo test` which runs binary unit tests including the tmux module. Tests passed correctly.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All infrastructure is in place: CLI parses 6 subcommands, DB layer connects with WAL, schema is migrated, config types parse squad.yml, tmux helpers enforce safety invariants
- Wave 2 plans (01-02 through 01-05) can implement command logic by filling in the stub `run()` functions
- The `todo!()` stubs will panic if invoked, which is correct behavior for unimplemented commands
- No blockers for Phase 1 Wave 2 plans
